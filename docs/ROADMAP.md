# AmbiColor – Roadmap

This document lists features explicitly excluded from v0.1
but already envisioned.

---

## v0.2 – Color Intelligence

- Automatic color naming (approximate, perceptual)
- Color category browser (e.g. dark orange, soft blue)
- Synchronization between numeric values and names
- Split the current "Natural / Artistic" blend into two dedicated presets:
- `Artistic`: palette transitions around red/yellow/blue families with curated crossfades (red/orange/yellow, yellow/green/blue, blue/purple/red, brown accents, optional randomness)
- `Natural`: nature-inspired color narratives (sky day/night, earth/green, blossom accents)

---

## v0.3 – Temporal Complexity

- Non-linear timing curves per preset
- Per-cycle variation
- BPM modulation patterns
- Preset calibration pass: review each preset together for expected transition character and smoothness

---

## v0.4 – Spatial Effects

- Gradients
- Waves
- Slow spatial movement
- Optional multi-zone displays

---

## v0.5 – Sequencer Concepts

- Matrix-based color sequencing
- Step-based color logic (inspired by music sequencers)

---

## v0.6 – Persistence & Sharing

- Preset export/import
- Human-readable preset files
- Versioned preset compatibility

---

## Long-Term Ideas

- Perceptual color spaces (OKLCH)
- External display control
- Research / educational modes
